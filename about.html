            <p >
    I started my love for developing web sites around 5 years ago when I was at Indiana Wesleyan University taking some courses in web developing. I was going to start my own web development company after graduation, but found that I needed to know a lot more to be successful in this field. I then had the opportunity to come to the 1150 academy in June 2016 and was able to compliment a lot of my skills. I love working on the front-end design even though I have a lot to learn with photoshop and illustrator. I like to work with dreamweaver and attend a lot of local meetup groups to learn more. I never want to stop learning and this field will definetly help me with that goal. My portfolio is a little different than what the ordinary person might have tried. I wanted to show different aspects of this field and even if I could not finish a project. I wanted to tackle many different things to at least try to figure out how it works. For example, I worked in Unity to create a basketball game and it was a 20 minute tutorial, which after spending 3 hours on it. I choose to stop where I was at and continue with the portfolio. It was a lot of fun and I will find some meetup groups to further my knowledge in that area as a hobby. I also started a business in this process to show my business side. I am not the ordinary candidate. I am very personable and hard working. I believe that if you love what you are doing then why not work 12 or more hours a day </p><br><p>
    On a more personable note. I am a husband to a wanderful wife, Jennifer. We will be celebrating our 20th anniversary this year. I was raised and live in the farm community of Rush County, Indiana. I have four awesome kids. They all turned 8 in May 2016. If you are confused. I understand, because i have quadruplets. If you are bored and want to see what quadruplets look like. My wife created a blog when they were born, but she has not kept up on it. The blog address is <a href="wainscottquadsindiana.blogspot.com/">wainscottquadsindiana.blogspot.com</a>. I have spent the last 25 years in the waste industry, mostly as a supervisor. I do carry a CDL license and can drive any trash truck out there. I also help with my kids schools PTO, I coach indoor and outdoor soccer, I help with the little kids football, I volunteer with Coder Dogo in Fishers on Saturday, and  I have also been asked to run in 2020 as a local political official. 
</p><br><p>
    I am looking for a position where I can continue to learn and improve my skills. I would like to work for a company that will invest in my future as much as I invest into their company. The possiblilty of helping in other areas of the business would be great down the road for me. In return I will give a company 25 years of business knowledge. I am great with customers, employees, and management personal. I have very high standards in integrity and confidentiality.
    </p><br><p>
     I look forward to talking to you soon, so please click on my contact page and send me a message.

  Just a little insight about me personally. I

    Thanks again, Sincerely Chris Wainscott
